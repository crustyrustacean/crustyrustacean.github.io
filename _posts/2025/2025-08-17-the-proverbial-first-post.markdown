Welcome to my yet-again-revitalized blog.

I had somewhat of a hissy-fit yesterday, I literally threw out my entire "developer" life and am now rebuilding it from scratch. I've been too reliant on AI and too focused on one programming language.

I need to diversify. I need to make the focus solving the problems.

This new blog will be a reflection of that.

Hope you enjoy!
