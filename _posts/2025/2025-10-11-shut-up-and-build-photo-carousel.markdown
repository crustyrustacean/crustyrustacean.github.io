I used to love Instagram.

The ability to share your creative photos with folks, in an easy way, and at the same time see what others were into, was really fun and nice.

Then Instagram became terrible, so I left. I wanted something of my own.

For years (literally) I tried different things and different ways to create a "photo blog". The major blocker, always, was:

"Where do I store the photos in a convenient way that scales for the future."

I never was able to answer this question, and I allowed it to be a blocker. Rather than muster the courage to ask questions and find solutions, I never built anything.

Well, Claude helped me see an easy answer.

You can store photos in a Github repo, then you get links to them.

Boom, done.

I now have a quick and dirty "photo-carousel". Needs work still, but it's started at least, thanks to the ease of a GitHub repo and Shuttle.

This literally cut through all the navel gazing and paralysis. I have a simple repo where I can swap out the photos, get some new links and do a quick manual update to show something new.

Moral of the story?

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
