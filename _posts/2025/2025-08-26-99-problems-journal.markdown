I'm starting up a new journal called "99 Problems". In it I will, shockingly, write about how I've solved 99 different little coding problems. I've had *great* difficulty learning to code over the past 4 years. I've come to understand I'm either reverse engineering or memorizing solutions. I've not adequately developed my own problem solving techniques or skills.

I think this will be a little more interesting to read than the Rust based content I've written. I don't think anyone really wants to read half-assed language/syntax type content from a learner.
